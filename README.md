Repo for the Programming for Data Analysis Assignment

# Project Plan (PP) and Overview
* For the README - (might be good to inlcude in initial Jupyter notebook for convience)

## Problem Statement - Explain the use of the Numpy.random package

1. Explain Overall purpose of the package
2. Explain the use of the *Simple random* data and *Permutations* functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five *Distribuitons" functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Software and Presentation
* Jupyter Notebook.
* Github for version control.
* https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html -V19 documentaion.
* Make full use of jupyter functionality in terms of code, plots, pictures, markdown etc.
* Git hub README just to contain what is in the REPO and how to run Jupyter notebook.
* Clean well referenced and concise coding

## 4 Problem Statements PP

### Overall purpose of the package
* Research - Google for blogposts and vlogposts, tutorials etc. on Numpy and numpy.random - (Stackoverflow, medium, science direct, towardsdatascience,  youtube and of course the official documentaion.
* References - Save relevant/suitable references links etc. for later.
* Examples through my own code.
* Attach any decent images, plots.

### *Simple random* data and *Permutations* functions
* Research - Go through the official documentaion - code using each parameter option.
* Apply my own code examples on each function - CODE REFERENCING TO DEMONSTRATE UNDERSTANDING.
* References - Save relevant/suitable references links etc. for later.

### five *Distributions" functions
* Google for blogposts and vlogposts for my chosen 5. Look at statistical resources on each of functions - wikipedia, mathisfun, youtube, revisionmaths.com
* Chose those who I may have encountered in the past or have some prior knowledge. Maybe: Normal, Poisson, Binominal, Pareto, Exponential
* Research - Go through the official documentaion - code using each parameter option.
* Apply my own code examples on each function - CODE REFERENCING TO DEMONSTRATE UNDERSTANDING.
* NB!!! to tie in the code with an explanation of the relevant statistical Distribution.
* References - Save relevant/suitable references links etc. for later.
* Attach Plot and image.

### use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
*  Google for blogposts and vlogposts - stackexchange, researchgate, wikipedia etc.
* Mention recent changes to how numpy calculates random seeds
* Research - Go through the official documentaion - code using each parameter option.
* Explain with coded examples the purpose of the seed generator
